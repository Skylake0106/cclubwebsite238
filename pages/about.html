                        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                        <p>The GVSU Computing Club is a made of a group of students interested in technology and computing. We strive to educate ourselves further in computing and always have a drive to learn as much as we can. We work on projects together, learn new topics and languages, and cultivate methods to land internships and jobs for work in the technology industry. We also love to have fun and do game nights and hangout to work on projects and study! If this sounds like your type of place stop on by!</p>

                        <h2>What We Do and Acomplish</h2>
                        <p>Our meetings are pretty diverse, ranging from the really fun and relaxed to learning how best to educate yourself about your future. Our main two goals is to educate and to network. For education we will learn new languages, technologies, and interests in the technology space. We do this by talking to each other, putting together presentations, bringing in professors to talk about their research, and even talk to local companies about their hiring and technology. For networking we work on building relationships between members for use as potential lab or research partners, colleagues, and as other students who are going through the same kinds of problems. We also build relationships within and outside GVSU, by brining in professors, the GVSU Graduate College, local companies, and local experts, we spread our network wide and provide opportunity for members to network with a large quanity of important and relavent people.</p>
